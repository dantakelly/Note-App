# Note-App v1.0.0

## Introduction
Note-App is my first capstone project where I've pursued to create a tool that allows users to conveniently jot down and store their notes directly on the web. While this initial version may not be the most polished or feature-rich, it lays down a solid foundation with all essential functionalities in place.


## Features
| Write and save notes effortlessly.
| Access your notes from any web-enabled device.
| Basic functionality for managing and organizing notes.


## Usage
1. Open the Note-App in your web browser by clicking this link - 

2. Start creating your new note by writing 
a title and content of the note.

3. Click the save button to store your note.

4. Click the icons with three lines under 
the save button to see save notes

5. On the save notes page section, click the new
note button to create a new note 


### Enjoy!!
